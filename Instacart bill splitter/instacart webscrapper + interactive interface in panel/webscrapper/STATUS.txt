Building a webscrapper for dynamics websites is lot more challenging.

Instacart website is not just a static html website. We also need to login to access a purticular page.

First, try to build a scrapper that uses a saved version of the receipt. But it has unneccessary details.

We could also look to build image recognition software that will look at the image a obtain the text.
scrapping from the website seems too complicated.
